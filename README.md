I worked on some aspects of the **USGS funded Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP) project** on Summer 2021. The works involved predictor development for the MAP-ML model, more specifically how to connect wells with field polygons, estimating a reference value for calculating effective rainfall, etc. The original machine learning model was built by my colleague Dr. Syanatan Majumdar and uses remote sensing and in-situ estimates to predict crop-specific groundwater pumping. A paper from this project in currently in prep.
